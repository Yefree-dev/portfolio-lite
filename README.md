# Portfolio Lite

A simple portfolio site just to showcase my skills, projects, and hobbies. I've made this site for accessibility purposes, so that I can share my projects and skills with the world regardless of the device or internet connection they might have.

My full Portfolio [yefree's portfolio](https://yefreevaldezdev.vercel.app).
