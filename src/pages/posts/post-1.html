          <p>
            A few years ago, I was working in business administration, following
            what felt like a “safe” and “logical” career path. But deep down, I
            knew it wasn’t truly what I wanted. I always admired how technology
            could solve real-world problems, and I found myself increasingly
            drawn to how software was shaping the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The turning point came when I realized I didn’t want to spend the
            next decade feeling stuck. I wanted to create, to build, and to
            solve problems in a different way. That’s when I decided to switch
            gears entirely and pursue a career in software engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, the idea was terrifying. I didn’t have a technical
            background, and the thought of starting from scratch was
            overwhelming. But I reminded myself that learning is a skill, and I
            had already developed resilience and problem-solving from my time in
            business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began by taking online courses, practicing coding every day, and
            working on small projects. Every bug I fixed and every program I
            built gave me a small but powerful sense of accomplishment. Slowly
            but surely, I was building not just technical skills, but also
            confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breaking into tech wasn’t easy. It required persistence, rejection,
            and a lot of self-belief. But my experience in business admin
            actually gave me an edge, I understood project management, I knew
            how to communicate with teams, and I was comfortable with structured
            problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back, I’m proud of the risks I took. Switching careers
            taught me that it’s never too late to follow a different path. If
            you’re thinking about changing careers, especially into tech, my
            advice is simple: be patient with yourself, keep showing up every
            day, and don’t be afraid to be a beginner.
